# Software Dev | Data Science | Scientific Computing
Hi! I'm Amanda Turney and I'm a software developer / data scientist who is driven to work on problems that make a difference for people and our planet. I have 8 years of experience working in climate tech and biotech, solving issues ranging from hurricane modeling to target identification and druggability for small molecules and RNA therapeutics. I love collaborating with scientists and technologists, mentoring others, and hacking away in a terminal/IDE while listening to EDM. 🎶  🌏  🧬

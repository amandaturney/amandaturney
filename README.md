# Software Dev | Data Science | Scientific Computing
Hi! I'm Amanda Turney and I'm a software developer / data scientist who is driven to work on problems that make a difference for people and our planet. I have 8 years of experience working in climate tech and biotech, solving issues ranging from hurricane modeling to target identification and druggability for small molecules and RNA therapeutics. I love collaborating with scientists and technologists, mentoring others, and hacking away in a terminal/IDE while listening to EDM. üé∂  üåè  üß¨

- <a href="">Quantum Computing Emulation in C++ with OpenMP</a>: This graduate level project emulates Shor's algorithm in an HPC environment utilizing the OpenMP library to manage qubit register states with threads. The 'omp task' pragma is used to spawn new threads whenever a Hadamard gate is encountered in 
                    the circuit and the 'task_reduction' pragma is used at the end of the circuit to sum the probability amplitudes for each output state.
                    Measurements are performed by randomly sampling the set of resulting states given their probability distributions.

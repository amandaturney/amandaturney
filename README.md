# Software Dev | Data Science | Scientific Computing
Hi! I'm Amanda Turney and I'm a software developer / data scientist who is driven to work on problems that _make a difference for people and our planet_. 

I have **8 years of experience** working in climate tech and biotech, solving issues ranging from hurricane modeling to target identification and druggability for small molecules and RNA therapeutics. 

I love collaborating with scientists and technologists, mentoring others, and hacking away in a terminal/IDE while listening to EDM. üåè  üé∂  üß¨

## Projects / Publications üî≠
### Quantum Computing
- **Quantum Machine Learning**: My capstone project for my MS in Data Science was an independent study on quantum machine learning. Notebooks and project work can be found in my qml repository and my final paper is listed below.

## Other Skills & Interests ‚ö°
Other than slinging code at work, I am passionate about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and have been an active leader throughout my career in this space by developing grassroot communication campaigns for education and awareness of important topics and creating, analyzing, and communicating the results of employee DEI surveys to C-suite and company-wide audiences.

Outside of work, I play way too many sports to actually be good at any single one of them. The list includes tennis, doubles beach volleyball, trail running, hiking, and rock climbing. I also love traveling and eating delicious foods.

My fun fact is that I have no reaction to mosquitoes biting me whatsoever; no bump, no itch, nothing. It's basically a super power....
